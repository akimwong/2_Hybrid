## DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH (DAG)
Is a conceptual representation of a series of activities. The order of the activities is depicted by a graph, which is visually presented as a set of circles, each one representing an activity, some of which are connected by lines, which represent the flow from one activity to another.

1. “Directed” means that each edge has a defined direction, so each edge necessarily represents a single directional flow from one vertex to another
2. “Acyclic” means that there are no loops (i.e., “cycles”) in the graph, so that for any given vertex, if you follow an edge that connects that vertex to another, there is no path in the graph to get back to that initial vertex
3. "Graph" is a collection of vertices (or point) and edges (or lines) that indicate connections between the vertices
